Using the command prompt brought up a few problems as my documents folder that I wanted to access was the wrong folder that my Gemfile was in. I had some problems getting my server to update my local website whenever I made changes but after updating tzinfo and restarting the server the problem went away. Another problem I had was trying to add links, there are many different ways to do this depending on what kind of link you a referencing, but I got it figured out in the end. I’m looking forward to get the blog to look nice and stylized, I hope that I will have less problems with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some useful links for me:&lt;/p&gt;
